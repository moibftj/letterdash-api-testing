# LetterDash - Comprehensive API Testing Project

## Project Overview
LetterDash is a robust API testing project designed to validate the functionality of a three-tier system with Users, Contractors, and Admins. The project is structured around automated tests that ensure the reliability and efficiency of various endpoints, including user authentication, coupon management, and letter generation using the OpenAI API. This README provides a comprehensive guide for installation, usage, features, dependencies, and project structure.

## Installation
To get started with the LetterDash project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/letterdash.git
   cd letterdash
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   You need to have Node.js and Yarn installed. If you don't have them, download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

   Once Node.js and Yarn are installed, run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your.api.url.here
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   Start the development server using:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Usage
To run tests, execute the following command:
```bash
python backend_test.py
```
This will trigger a series of predefined tests for various API endpoints and print the results in the terminal.

## Features
- **User Management**: Register, login, and retrieve user information securely.
- **Role Management**: Different functionalities based on user roles (user, contractor, admin).
- **Coupon System**: Create, validate, and register users using coupons.
- **Letter Generation**: Generate customizable letters based on user input and utilize OpenAI for content generation.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API interactions and validation.

## Dependencies
This project is built using Node.js with a variety of dependencies to manage functionality and ensure smooth performance. Key dependencies include:

- **React & Next.js**: Build the frontend and manage routing.
- **MongoDB**: Used for data storage and management.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
- **OpenAI**: To integrate advanced letter generation capabilities.
- Various **Radix UI** components for streamlined UI design.

Below are the key dependencies from `package.json`:
